<div class="Day 1"> <p> Day 1 (1/19/24)- We are learning HTML and CSS basics today. I included a picture of a guinea pig, added a link, and changed font and background colors of my site. I had a nose bleed this class and I was really brave about it even if my mask was covered in blood. The guinea pig picture I put in is a picture of a brown and white striped Teddy breed guinea pig. I had a teddy breed guinea pig, but she was completely white.</p> </div>
   <div class="Day 2"> <p>Day 2 (1/26/24)- We learned how to change the favicon amd create lists using HTML. I also learned how to use div tags today.</p> </div>
